# Visualising and Cleaning Sales Data of a Restaurant
## Overview 
The goal of this project is to design an interactive dashboard that helps restaurant stakeholders track sales performance, customer paying behaviour and revenue trends.  
The original dataset, cleaned dataset, pivot tables and dashboard can all be found [here](https://github.com/dtan20441/portfolio_restaurant_sales/blob/main/restaurant_sales_data.xlsx).

Here is a snapshot of the dashboard: ![restaurant dashboard](https://github.com/dtan20441/portfolio_restaurant_sales/blob/main/restaurant_dashboard.png)

## Data structure
The dataset consists of 1 table with 17,535 rows.

## Process
1. **Data cleaning**: Item names and prices were missing, with some of the empty values being resolved using known information. Some inconsistent formats, such as "Beef Chili" and "Beef Chilli".
2. **Visualisations from Pivot Tables**: 
- Line chart for revenue trend.
- Horizontal bar chart for top performing menu items.
- Pie chart for payment method distribution.
- Vertical bar chart for category-level revenue contribution.
3. **KPI cards**: Created dynamic KPI cards (Average Order Value, Count of Orders, Total Revenue) using Pivot Tables.
4. **Dashboard design**: Applied consisting formatting, colours and visualisation placements for a professional appearance.
