# Visualising and Cleaning Sales Data of a Restaurant
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the cleaning and visualising of sales data on an interactive dashboard using Excel from a dummy restaurant where each row represents a different order made by a customer.  
The original dataset, cleaned dataset, pivot tables and dashboard can all be found here [here](https://github.com/dtan20441/portfolio_restaurant_sales/blob/main/restaurant_sales_data.xlsx).

Here is a snapshot of the dashboard: ![restaurant dashboard](https://github.com/dtan20441/portfolio_restaurant_sales/blob/main/restaurant_dashboard.png)

## Process
1. **Data cleaning**: Checked for missing values and tried filling them in based on known information.
2. **Visualisations from Pivot Tables**: 
- Line chart for revenue trend.
- Horizontal bar chart for top performing menu items.
- Pie chart for payment method distribution.
- Vertical bar chart for category-level revenue contribution.
3. **KPI cards**: Created dynamic KPI cards (Average Order Value, Count of Orders, Total Revenue) using Pivot Tables.
4. **Dashboard design**: Applied consisting formatting, colours and visualisation placements for a professional appearance.
